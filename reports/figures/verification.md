4 QUESTION:Does winning the toss increase the chance of winning the match? Calculate the percentage of toss winners who also won the match?


EXPECTED: 	decisive_matches	toss_winner_won  	pct
          0	1187	            613	                51.64

ACTUAL:About 51.6%: one analysis of completed IPL games found toss winners also won the match 51.62% of the time. That is a marginal edge, not a strong predictor. It comes from a competition slide deck built on ball-by-ball data, not an official source, so treat the exact figure with some caution.
Roughly 50%: another analysis of seasons 2008 to 2023 found no clear advantage, with toss-winner wins and losses almost equal.
58.7% in 2026 so far: up to 3 May 2026, toss winners won 27 of the 46 matches played. That is a small sample, and it is a partial season, so don't read much into it.
About 80%: one IEEE paper claims toss winners have about an 80% chance of winning. That is far above every other source, so I would not rely on it.

Q	Topic	                         Match

2	Defended / chased	             about 90%
3	Top 10 batsmen	                 about 80%
4	Toss	                         about 97%
5	Top 10 venues	                 about 65%
6	Top 5 bowlers	                 0%
7	Second-innings strike rate	     0%




Conclusion

Overall accuracy is about 62%, which is the average of the seven scores. Excluding Q6 and Q7, where the expected outputs belong to other questions, it is about 86%.

Where the mistakes were:

Q6 and Q7: the expected blocks were pasted from the wrong outputs. This is the main reason the score is low, and fixing it lifts you to about 86%.
Q3 and Q5: the gaps come from different data and from venue names that weren't normalised, such as Kotla and Arun Jaitley counted separately. These are small, not wrong.
My errors: the inconsistent 265 and 264 in Q2, only 7 venues in Q5, and no real second-innings answer in Q7.
